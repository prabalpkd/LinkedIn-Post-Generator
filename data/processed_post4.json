Beautiful by heart - deeply care about everyone.\n\nWhen I talk to them - they actually care about candidates - I remember having a conversation with 1 of my friends and he was sad because the other HR in his team did not close the job posting even after hiring someone and he fought with him and took it to upper management. Man of values :)\n\nI appreciate the values that they hold!\n\nThen I met the other kind of HR -\n\nOoh, my worst nightmare.\n\nThe ones who\u2026\n\nRead employees\u2019 private chats when laptops were returned after resignation.\n\nTreated colleagues like \u2018personal assistants.\u2019\n\nSpread gossip about people\u2019s bodies and personal lives.\n\nTook credit for others\u2019 work but never lifted a finger when it came to responsibility.\n\nEveryone I knew in that company had some complaints about that person.\n\nI\u2019ve seen employees cry because of them.\n\nI\u2019ve seen careers stall because of their politics.\n\nI\u2019ve seen people lose respect for the HR role itself - just because of a few rotten apples.\n\nSo yes, HRs are not all the same.\n\nSome of them become your strongest support system.\n\nSome of them become your worst nightmare.\n\nBut here\u2019s my request:\nDon\u2019t mock the entire profession.
