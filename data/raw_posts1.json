    "text": "A recent survey found that 68% of job seekers applied to roles that were never actively hiring.\n\nAnother report revealed that over 40% of job postings online are ‘ghost jobs.’\n\nWhy do companies do this?\n\nTo look like they are growing (good for investors).\n\nTo build a candidate pipeline they’ll never call.\n\nTo make employees think ‘we are hiring, so business is great.’\n\nSometimes just to collect free resumes for future reference.\n\nBut the impact?\n\n70% of candidates report feeling ‘demotivated’ when they realize the job was never real.\n\nPeople waste hours applying, editing resumes, and preparing for nothing.\n\nIt worsens the already fragile mental health of job seekers.\n\nGhost hiring isn’t just unethical - it’s cruel.\nWhen hope is given without intention, it becomes exploitation.\n\nIf you’ve ever refreshed your inbox waiting for a reply that never comes - you’re not alone.\n\nAnd if you’re a company doing this? Remember: reputation is harder to rebuild than a candidate pipeline.\n\nJob seekers deserve honesty. Not illusions",

Beautiful by heart - deeply care about everyone.\n\nWhen I talk to them - they actually care about candidates - I remember having a conversation with 1 of my friends and he was sad because the other HR in his team did not close the job posting even after hiring someone and he fought with him and took it to upper management. Man of values :)\n\nI appreciate the values that they hold!\n\nThen I met the other kind of HR -\n\nOoh, my worst nightmare.\n\nThe ones who…\n\nRead employees’ private chats when laptops were returned after resignation.\n\nTreated colleagues like ‘personal assistants.’\n\nSpread gossip about people’s bodies and personal lives.\n\nTook credit for others’ work but never lifted a finger when it came to responsibility.\n\nEveryone I knew in that company had some complaints about that person.\n\nI’ve seen employees cry because of them.\n\nI’ve seen careers stall because of their politics.\n\nI’ve seen people lose respect for the HR role itself - just because of a few rotten apples.\n\nSo yes, HRs are not all the same.\n\nSome of them become your strongest support system.\n\nSome of them become your worst nightmare.\n\nBut here’s my request:\nDon’t mock the entire profession. Appreciate the good ones.\n\nBecause the right HR can change your career.\nThe wrong one can ruin your mental health.\n\nSo, next time you think of HR - don’t just remember the bad stories.\n\nRemember the ones who quietly fight for you behind the scenes too!",
